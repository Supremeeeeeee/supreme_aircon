![aircondp|690x495, 50%](upload://dDZB6z8qUjUm9wscQ5JrdChurcr.jpeg)


This script allows players to search any aircon in the game to acquire items that they find. This is easily modified and can have the potential to be a good script

### Actions
* Search any aircon in the city
* There's a chance you won't find anything ( notification to be added for this )
* Aircons have a cooldown timer after you search it (5 mins) < Configurable
* Get random items from aircons based on chance, you always get scrap or steel
* You have to use your own npc script
* Utilizes BT-Target to search aircons
* Go to location and sell scrap metal for money ( map blip )
* Custom sell scrap or steel menu
* Police get notified on stealing air cons ( can set the percentage in config ) (linden-outlawalert)
* Can set how many cops online before you can scrap
